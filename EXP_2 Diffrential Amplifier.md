# Aim
  Design and analyze the mos differential amplifier circuit for the following specification.

# Components Required
  NMOS,Resistor,voltage source,current source

# Theory
  A differential amplifier rejects common-mode signals by design, leveraging the fact that it amplifies only the difference between the voltages at the two inputs (non-inverting and inverting), while it rejects any signals that are common to both inputs. This ability to reject common-mode signals is due to its common-mode rejection mechanism.

# Calculation(theoretical)

| Parameter | Symbol | Value |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Supply Voltage | Vdd | 2 V |
| Voltage at Source | Vp | 0.4 V |
| Power | P | 1m W |
| Input Common Mode Voltage | Vicm | 1 V |
| Output Common Mode Voltage | Vocm | 1.1 V |
| Source Current | Iss | 0.5m A |
| Drain Current (each transistor) | Id1 = Id2 | 0.25m A |
| Drain Resistance | Rd1=Rd2 | 3.6k ohn |
| Source Resistance | Rss | 800 ohm |

1. **Determine Iss (Source Current):** 
Iss = P / Vdd
Iss = 1*10^-3 /2
Iss = 0.5m A

2. **Calculate Rd (Drain Resistance):**  
Id1 = Id2 = Iss
Id1=Iss/2
Id1=0.25mA

3. **Calculate Rss (Source Resistance):** 
Rd = ( Vdd -Vocm)/Id1
Rd = (2-1.1) / 0.25mA
Rd = 3.6k ohm

## What is the requirment of replacing the resister RS and current source by a MOSFET in differential amplifier ?

*In a differential amplifier, we replace the source resistor (Rs) and current source with a MOSFET current mirror for these reasons:*
- *Higher Gain â€“ A MOSFET as a current source provides a much higher output resistance compared to a resistor, increasing gain.*
- *Better Current Matching â€“ A MOSFET current mirror ensures precise current balancing between transistors, improving circuit symmetry*.
- *Improved Common-Mode Rejection (CMRR) â€“ It enhances the amplifierâ€™s ability to reject common-mode signals, making it more stable*.
- *Reduced Voltage Drop â€“ A current source MOSFET requires less voltage headroom than a resistor, improving the amplifier's efficiency*.
